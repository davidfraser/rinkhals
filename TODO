== TODO ==

* Still need cursors/sprites for:
  -- Cut Trees
  -- Sell ...
    -- Chicken (too similar to move)
    -- Egg (too similar to move)
    -- Building (too similar to move)
    -- Equipment
  -- Buy ...
    -- Fence
    -- Helmet
    -- Kevlar

* Add invalid cursor sprite

* Animations? (Fox catching chicken (with feathers), demolition foxes blowing things up?)

* Add the demolition fox

* <confluence> We should have text images instead of buttons (in the various menus and toolbars).

* <Nitwit> And we need to start testing for lose conditions, and set an upper time limit
  * <Nitwit> 30 days good as a starting limit?
  * <Hodgestar> Sounds good. What happens when the 30 days are up?
  * <Hodgestar> Some kind of high-score table?
  * <jerith> I'm thinking win conditions should be a number of chickens and a cash balance at the end of the level.
  * <Nitwit> I'm adding a game over state - I was thinking of only a "You lost" or "Score : x" message for tonight
  * <Nitwit> where score = cash + WEIGHT*chickens, for some value of WEIGHT
  * <jerith> Maybe make level a fixed number of days -- a fortnight seems a good balance.
  * <Nitwit> given the current time to hatch chickens, I worry that a fornight is too short
  * <jerith> How long does it take to hatch chickens?
  * <jerith> Actually, I'm probably overestimating the amount of  work that will go into a day.
  * <Nitwit> jerith: 2 nights, so a fornight gives at most 7 cycles
  * <Nitwit> but we can fiddle with values for game balance tomorrow and Friday
  * <Hodgestar> Maybe score = cash + (chicken sell price)*chickens.
  * <Hodgestar> I.e. what you would get if you converted all your chickens to cash at the end.
  * <Hodgestar> jerith says to add (egg sell price)*eggs too.

  -- Game over & time limit implemented with final score.
  -- High score support still needed (pgu.high ?)
  -- Need to remove current 'd' shortcut
  -- Should esc take us to a different state than won / lost?

* <tzhau> simchicken! so are there gonna to be chicken processing plants? escaping chickens?
  * <Hodgestar> tzhau: We could add some sort of self-managing henhouse that sells chickens automatically to make space for hatching eggs.
