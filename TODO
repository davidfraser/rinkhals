== TODO ==

* Still need cursors/sprites for:
  -- Cut Trees
  -- Sell ...
    -- Chicken (too similar to move)
    -- Egg (too similar to move)
    -- Building (too similar to move)
    -- Equipment

* Still price text for:
  -- Cut Trees
  -- All Sell tools
  -- Buy Fence
  -- Buy Equipment

* Animations?
  -- Muzzle flashes done.
  -- Still need:
     -- Fox gibbing chicken (with feathers)
     -- Sapper foxes blowing things up?

* Balance game (game length, profits & costs, etc.) 

== POST PYWEEK ==

* Add invalid cursor sprite

* <confluence> We should have text images instead of buttons (in the various menus and toolbars).

* Persistent high scores 

* Better fox move logic
