== TODO ==

* Still need cursors/sprites for:
  -- Cut Trees
  -- Sell ...
    -- Chicken (too similar to move)
    -- Egg (too similar to move)
    -- Building (too similar to move)
    -- Equipment
  -- Buy ...
    -- Helmet
    -- Kevlar

* Animations?
  -- Muzzle flashes done.
  -- Still need:
     -- Fox gibbing chicken (with feathers)
     -- Sapper foxes blowing things up?

* <Nitwit> And we need to start testing for lose conditions, and set an upper time limit
  -- Think about length of game (i.e. number of days)

== POST PYWEEK ==

* Add invalid cursor sprite

* <confluence> We should have text images instead of buttons (in the various menus and toolbars).
