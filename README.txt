A first PyWeek entry by the hackers of the Cape Town Python Users Group
(CTPUG). The theme for PyWeek 9 was "Feather".


RUNNING THE GAME
================

It is likely that you have obtain the game in one of four possible ways:

Windows:

If you have the Windows .zip file, unzip it, find foxassault.exe and
doube-click it to launch the game.

Unix:

If you have the Unix .tgz file, make sure you have Python and pygame
installed. The extract the tar file and run "python run_game.py" from
inside the extracted folder.

Mac OS X:

If you have the Mac OS X .dmg file, double-click to open it. Drag
Operation Fox Assault to Applications to install. Alternatively,
double-click on Operation Fox Assault to run it.

Source:

If you have obtained the source directly, you need to install the
dependencies listed further down. Then run "python run_game.py".


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
====================

Save the chickens!

The aim of the game is to make as much money as possible from your chicken
farm. The problem is the foxes, which want to eat your chickens.  Since hiring
guards is both too expensive and unreliable, the obvious solution is to help
the chickens defend themselves.

You lose if you end a night with no chickens left.

Depending on the game length you select, you win if you survive for two weeks,
three months or until you have chopped down all the trees in the forest and
caused the complete extinction of the fox population.

Chickens only lay eggs in henhouses, and must stay on the egg for 2 days to
hatch a new chicken. Chickens that hatch in already full henhouses are
moved to just outside. If there is no space outside, they die immediately
from overcrowding.
