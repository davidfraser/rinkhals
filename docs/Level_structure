Levels are stored as two files.

The level.tga file provides the tilemap for the starting layout. We use
two layers of pgu's tilemap - the tile layer, for the objects of interest,
and the code layer, which indicates the starting horse positions.

Different codes mean horses ahve different levels of equipment.

01 - horse with no equipment
02 - horse with helmet
03 - horse with kevlar
04 - horse with knife
05 - horse with rifle
06 - horse with kevlar & helmet
07 - horse with helmet & knife
08 - horse with kevlar & knife
09 - horse with kevlar, helmet & knife
10 - horse with helmet & rifle
11 - horse with kevlar & rifle
12 - horse with kevlar, helmet & rifle
