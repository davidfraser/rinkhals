Levels are stored as two files.

The level.tga file provides the tilemap for the starting layout. We use
two layers of pgu's tilemap - the tile layer, for the objects of interest,
and the code layer, which indicates the starting chicken positions.

Different codes mean chickens ahve different levels of equipment.

01 - chicken with no equipment
02 - chicken with helmet
03 - chicken with kevlar
04 - chicken with knife
05 - chicken with rifle
06 - chicken with kevlar & helmet
07 - chicken with helmet & knife
08 - chicken with kevlar & knife
09 - chicken with kevlar, helmet & knife
10 - chicken with helmet & rifle
11 - chicken with kevlar & rifle
12 - chicken with kevlar, helmet & rifle
